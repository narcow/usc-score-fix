Works with Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone.

Usage:

1. Rename your old `maps.db` to `corrupt.db`
2. Create a new `maps.db` by launching `usc-game`
3. Copy both db files to the script location and run the script.
4. Copy modified `maps.db` back into the unnamed-sdvx-clone directory.

Note:

This works by matching chart file paths.
